## Handlers in Ansible are special tasks that execute only when notified by another task.
## They are typically used to manage services, such as restarting a service after a configuration change.
## Unlike regular tasks, handlers run at the end of the play, ensuring that services are only restarted once,
## even if multiple tasks notify the same handler.
## This approach enhances efficiency and prevents unnecessary service interruptions.
