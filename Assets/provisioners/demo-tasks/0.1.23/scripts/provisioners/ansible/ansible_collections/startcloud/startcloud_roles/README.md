## STARTcloud Roles
STARTcloud Roles is a collection of Ansible roles designed to secure and prepare virtual machines (VMs) for use with SSL, configure services, and install dependencies. It is part of the STARTcloud ecosystem, working in conjunction with the Core Provisioner to automate the provisioning and configuration of VMs. This project enhances the security and functionality of VMs by providing a structured approach to role management and deployment.

## Key Features

- **Role Management**: Offers a comprehensive set of Ansible roles for various aspects of VM preparation and configuration.
- **SSL Preparation**: Automates the process of securing VMs with SSL certificates, ensuring secure communication.
- **Service Configuration**: Simplifies the setup of necessary services on VMs, streamlining the deployment process.
- **Dependency Installation**: Handles the installation of required dependencies, reducing manual setup efforts.


### ~~Including STARTcloud Roles~~

1. **~~Add STARTcloud Roles as a Git Submodule~~**: ~~First, ensure that STARTcloud Roles is added as a submodule to your project. This can be done using the following command:~~

~~git submodule add -b submodule https://github.com/STARTcloud/startcloud_roles startcloud_roles~~
   ~~Replace `path/to/submodule` with the desired path within your project where you want to include STARTcloud Roles.~~

2. **~~Update the Submodule~~**: 
~~After cloning your project, navigate to the submodule directory and pull the latest changes:~~

~~bash cd path/to/submodule git pull origin main~~

### Interacting with `Hosts.yml` and `Hosts.rb`

To integrate STARTcloud Roles with the Core Provisioner, specifically with the `Hosts.yml` and `Hosts.rb` files, follow these steps:

STARTcloud Roles enhances the provisioning process by automating the configuration of VMs. To utilize these roles effectively, they need to be referenced within the `Hosts.yml` for the Core Provisioner `Hosts.rb`.

1. **Reference Roles in `Hosts.yml`**: Within the `Hosts.yml` file, you can specify which roles from STARTcloud Roles should be applied to a particular host. This is done by including the role names under the `roles` key for each host configuration. For example:
```
hosts: all
roles: 
  - startcloud.startcloud_roles.ssl
  - startcloud.startcloud_roles.service_user
```


   This configuration indicates that the `ssl_setup` and `service_configuration` roles from STARTcloud Roles should be applied to all hosts via `all`.

2. **Execution in `Hosts.rb`**: The `Hosts.rb` script is responsible for interpreting the `Hosts.yml` file and generating the necessary Vagrant configurations. When the `Hosts.rb` script encounters a host configuration that includes roles, it automatically applies these roles during the provisioning process. There's no need for additional modifications in `Hosts.rb` for this purpose, as the script is designed to handle role application based on the `Hosts.yml` configurations.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate STARTcloud Roles with the Core Provisioner, leveraging the power of Ansible roles to automate the configuration and security of your VMs. This approach enhances the flexibility and extensibility of your provisioning process, allowing for a more declarative and manageable setup.
